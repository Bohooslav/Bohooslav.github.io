        <p id="thework">THE WORK, in its present form, is not to be considered as intended to
                come into competition with the <em>ordinary</em> use of the commonly received
                English Version of the Holy Scriptures, but simply as a strictly literal
                and idiomatic rendering of the Original Hebrew and Greek Texts. For
                about twenty years--fully half his life-time--the Translator has had a
                desire to execute such a work, and has been engaged in Biblical pursuits
                tending to this end more or less exclusively; and now, at last, in the
                good providence of God, the desire has been accomplished. How far he has
                been able to carry out the just principles of Biblical Translation,
                founded on a solid and immoveable foundation, time alone will tell, and
                for this he confidently waits. As these <em>principles</em> are to some extent
                new, and adhered to with a severity never hitherto attempted, and as the
                Translator has perfect confidence in their accuracy and simplicity, he
                proceeds at once to state them distinctly and broadly, that not merely
                the learned, but the wayfaring man need not err in appreciating their
                value.</p>

        <p>
                There are two modes of translation which may be adopted in
                rendering into our own language the writings of an ancient author; the
                one is, to bring him before us in such a manner as that we may <em>regard
                        him as our own</em>; the other, to <em>transport ourselves</em>, on the contrary,
                <em>over to him, adopting his situation, modes of speaking, thinking,
                        acting,--peculiarities of age and race, air, gesture, voice, &amp;c</em>. Each
                of these plans has its advantages, but the latter is incomparably the
                better of the two, being suited--not for the ever-varying modes of
                thinking and acting of the men of the fifth, or the tenth, or the
                fifteenth, or some other century, but--for all ages alike. All attempts
                to make Moses or Paul act, or speak, or reason, as if they were
                Englishmen of the nineteenth century, must inevitably tend to change the
                translator into a paraphrast or a commentator, characters which, however
                useful, stand altogether apart from that of him, who, with a work before
                him in one language, seeks only to transfer it into another.

        </p>
        <p>
                In prosecuting the plan thus adopted, a literal translation was
                indispensable. No other kind of rendering could place the reader in the
                position contemplated, side by side with the writer--prepared to think
                as <em>he</em> does, to see as <em>he</em> sees, to reason, to feel, to weep, and to
                exult along with him. His very conception of time, even in the minor
                accidents of the grammatical past, present, future, are to become our
                own. If he speaks of an event, as <em>now</em> passing, we are not, on the
                logical ground of its having in reality already transpired, to translate
                his present as if it were a past; or if, on the other hand, his
                imagination pictures the future as if even at this moment present, we
                are not translators but expounders, and that of a tame description, if
                we take the liberty to convert his time, and tense--the grammatical
                expression of his time--into our own. King James' translators were
                almost entirely unacquainted with the two distinctive peculiarities of
                the Hebrew mode of thinking and speaking, admitted by the most profound
                Hebrew scholars in <em>theory</em>, though, from undue timidity, never carried
                out in <em>practice</em>, viz:--
        <ol>
                <li type="I">That the Hebrews were in the habit of using the past tense to express
                        the <em>certainty</em> of an action taking place, even though the action might
                        not really be performed for some time. And
                </li>
                <li>That the Hebrews, in referring to events which might be either
                        <em>past</em> or <em>future</em> were accustomed to act on the principle of
                        transferring themselves mentally to the period and place of the events
                        themselves, and were not content with coldly viewing them as those of a
                        bygone or still coming time; hence the very frequent use of the
                        <em>present</em> tense.
                </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
        <p>These two great principles of the Hebrew language are
                substantially to be found in the works of Lee, Gesenius, Ewald, &amp;c.; but
                the present writer has carried them out in translation much beyond what
                any of these ever contemplated, on the simple ground that, if they are
                true, they ought to be gone through with. While they affect very
                considerably the outward <em>form</em> of the translation, it is a matter of
                thankfulness that they do not touch the <em>truth</em> of a single Scripture
                doctrine--<em>not even one</em>.</p>

        <p>
                Every effort has been made to secure a comparative degree of
                uniformity in rendering the original words and phrases. Thus, for
                example, the Hebrew verb <em>nathan</em>, which is rendered by King James'
                translators in <em>sixty-seven</em> different ways (see in the subsequent page,
                entitled 'Lax Renderings,') has been restricted and reduced to <em>ten</em>,
                and so with many others. It is the Translator's ever-growing conviction,
                that even this smaller number may be reduced still further.

        </p>
        <p>
                It has been no part of the Translator's plan to attempt to form
                a New Hebrew or Greek Text--he has therefore somewhat rigidly adhered to
                the received ones. Where he has differed, it is generally in reference
                to the punctuation and accentuation, the division of words and
                sentences, which, being merely traditional, are, of course, often
                imperfect. For an explanation and vindication of these differences, the
                reader is referred to the "Concise Commentary," which is designed to
                supplement the present volume.

        </p>
        <p>
                The Translator has often had occasion to regret the want of a
                marginal column to insert the various renderings of passages where he
                has been unable to satisfy his own mind--he has, however, cast the chief
                of these into an appendix, under the title, "Additions and Corrections."
                and still more elaborately in the supplementary volume.

        <h5 id="Style of the Sacred Writers, and of this Translation.">Style of the Sacred Writers, and of this Translation.</h5>

        <p>ONE of the first things that is likely to attract the attention of the
                Readers of this New Translation is its lively, picturesque, dramatic
                style, by which the inimitable beauty of the Original Text is more
                vividly brought out than by any previous Translation. It is true that
                the Revisers appointed by King James have occasionally imitated it, but
                only in a few familiar phrases and colloquialisms, chiefly in the Gospel
                Narrative, and without having any settled principles of translation to
                guide them on the point. The exact force of the Hebrew tenses has long
                been a vexed question with critics, but the time cannot be far distant
                when the <em>general</em> principles of the late learned Professor Samuel Lee
                of Cambridge, with some modification, will be generally adopted <em>in
                        substance</em>, if not in theory. It would be entirely out of place here to
                enter into details on this important subject, but a very few remarks
                appear necessary, and may not be unacceptable to the student.</p>
        <ol>

                <li type="I">It would appear that the Hebrew writers, when narrating or
                        describing events which might be either <em>past</em> or <em>future</em> (such as the
                        case of Moses in reference to the <em>Creation</em> or the <em>Deluge</em>, on the one
                        hand, and to the <em>Coming of the Messiah</em> or the <em>Calamities which were
                                to befall Israel</em>, on the other), uniformly wrote as if they were alive
                        at the time of the occurrence of the events mentioned, and as
                        <em>eye-witnesses</em> of what they are narrating.

                        <p>
                                It would be needless to refer to special passages in elucidation
                                or vindication of this principle essential to the proper understanding
                                of the Sacred Text, as every page of this Translation affords abundant
                                examples. It is only what common country people do in this land at the
                                present day, and what not a few of the most popular writers in England
                                aim at and accomplish--placing themselves and their readers in the times
                                and places of the circumstances related.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                This principle of translation has long been admitted by the best
                                Biblical Expositors in reference to the <em>Prophetic Delineation</em> of
                                Gospel times, but it is equally applicable and necessary to the
                                historical narratives of Genesis, Ruth, etc.

                        </p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                </li>
                <li>The Hebrew writers often express the <em>certainty of a thing
                                taking place</em> by putting it in the <em>past</em> tense, though the actual
                        fulfilment may not take place for ages. This is easily understood and
                        appreciated when the language is used by God, as when He says, in Gen.
                        xv. 18, "Unto thy seed <em>I have given</em> this land;" and in xvii. 4, "I,
                        lo, My covenant <em>is</em> with thee, and <em>thou hast become</em> a father of a
                        multitude of nations."

                        <p>
                                The same thing is found in Gen. xxiii. 11, where Ephron answers
                                Abraham: "Nay, my lord, hear me; the field <em>I have given</em> to thee, and
                                the cave that is in it; to thee <em>I have given</em> it; before the eyes of
                                the sons of my people <em>I have given</em> it to thee; bury thy dead." And
                                again in Abraham's answer to Ephron: "Only--if thou wouldst hear me--<em>I
                                        have given</em> the money of the field; accept from me, and I bury my dead
                                there." Again in 2 Kings v. 6, the King of Syria, writing to the King of
                                Israel, says: "Lo, I have sent unto thee Naaman, my servant, and <em>thou
                                        hast recovered him</em> from his leprosy,"--considering the King of Israel
                                as his servant, a mere expression of the master's purpose is sufficient.
                                In Judges viii. 19, Gideon says to Zebah and Zalmunnah, "If ye had kept
                                them alive, <em>I had not slain you.</em>" So in Deut. xxxi. 18, "For all the
                                evils that <em>they have done</em>"--shall have done.

                        </p>

                                It would be easy to multiply examples, but the above may suffice
                                for the present. Some of these forms of expression are preceded by the
                                conjunction "<em>and</em>" (waw, in Hebrew), and a very common opinion has been
                                that the conjunction in these cases has a <em>conversive power</em>, and that
                                the verb is not to be translated <em>past</em> (though so in grammatical form),
                                but <em>future</em>. This is, of course, only an <em>evasion </em>of the supposed
                                difficulty, not a <em>solution</em>, and requires to be supported by the
                                equally untenable hypothesis that a (so-called) <em>future</em> tense, when
                                preceded by the same conjunction <em>waw</em> ("and,") often becomes a past.
                                Notwithstanding these two converting hypotheses, there are numerous
                                passages which have no conjunction before them, which can only be
                                explained by the principle stated above.

                <li> The Hebrew writers are accustomed to express laws,
                        commands, etc., in four ways:
                        <ol>

                                <li>By the regular imperative form, e.g., "<em>Speak</em> unto the people."

                                <li>By the infinitive, "Every male of you <em>is to be</em> circumcised."

                                </li>
                                <li>By the (so-called) future, "<em>Let</em> there be light;" "Thou <em>shalt</em>
                                        do no murder; " "Six days <em>is</em> work done."

                                </li>
                                <li>By the past tense, "Speak unto the sons of Israel, and <em>thou
                                                hast said</em> unto them."
                                </li>

                                There can be no good reason why these several peculiarities
                                should not be exhibited in the translation of the Bible, or that they
                                should be confounded, as they often are, in the Common Version. In
                                common life among ourselves, these forms of expression are frequently
                                used for imperatives, e.g., "Go and do this,"--"This is to be done
                                first,"--"You shall go,"--"You go and finish it." There are few
                                languages which afford such opportunities of a literal and idiomatic
                                rendering of the Sacred Scriptures as the English tongue, and the
                                present attempt will be found, it is believed, to exhibit this more than
                                any other Translation.

        <p>THE uncertain state of Hebrew criticism in reference to the Tenses is so
                fully exhibited in the following extracts from one of the latest, and in
                some respects one of the best, grammatical Commentaries (by the Rev. J.
                A. Alexander, of Princeton, New Jersey), on the Book of Isaiah, that the
                reader's attention to them is specially requested.</p>

        <p>
                On Isa. 5.13, Prof. A. remarks:--'Luther, Gesenius, and
                Hendewerk take [the verb] as a future, which is not to be assumed
                without necessity. Most recent writers evade the difficulty by rendering
                it in the present tense. The only natural construction is the old one
                (Septuagint, Vulgate, Vitringa, Barnes), which gives the preterite its
                proper meaning, and either supposes the future to be here, <em>as often
                        elsewhere</em>, spoken of as already past,' &amp;c.
                <small>[This principle, though admitted and maintained by Gesenius,
                        Lee, &amp;c. has never been acted upon, to any extent, by any Translator
                        till the present. It is the only principle, however, that can carry us
                        through every difficulty in the Sacred Scriptures.]</small>

        </p>
        <p>
                On chap. 5.25, 'The future form given to the verbs by Clericus
                is altogether arbitrary. Most of the later writers follow Luther in
                translating them as presents. But, if this verse is not descriptive of
                the past, as distinguished from the present and the future, the Hebrew
                language is incapable of making any such distinction.'
                <small>[Let this principle be carried out, as it ought to be, and
                        nine-tenths of the common critical works on the Bible are rendered
                        perfectly useless, and positively injurious.]</small>

        </p>
        <p>
                On chap. 5.26, 'Here, as in v.25, the older writers understand
                the verbs as future, but the later ones as present. The verbs in the
                last clause have waw prefixed, but its conversive power commonly depends
                upon a future verb preceding, which is wanting here.'
                <small>[And so it is in dozens of places where Prof. A. follows in the
                        usual wake of critics.]</small>

        </p>
        <p>
                On chap. 5.27, 'The English Version follows Calvin in
                translating all the verbs as <em>future</em>. The Vulgate supplies the present
                in the first clause, and makes the others future. But as the whole is
                evidently one description, the translation should be uniform, and as the
                preterite and future forms are intermingled, both <em>seem</em> to be here used
                for the <em>present</em>, which is given by Luther, and most of the late
                writers.'
                <small>[Here, leaving all certainty and settled principles behind him,
                        Prof. A. tells us how he thinks the inspired writer ought to have
                        written, not what he did write.]</small>

        </p>
        <p>
                On chap. 8.2, 'The Vulgate takes the verb as a <em>preterite</em>, and
                Gesenius, Maurer, Knobel read accordingly with waw conversive. The
                Septuagint, Targum, and Peshito make it <em>imperative</em>, and Hitzig
                accordingly. Gesenius formerly preferred an indirect or <em>subjunctive</em>
                construction, which is still retained by Henderson.' <small>[Here are <em>four</em>
                        ancient versions and, <em>five</em> modern critics at fives and sixes regarding
                        what is as simple as can well be imagined!]</small>

        </p>
        <p>
                On chap. 9.7, 'Another false antithesis is that between the
                verbs, referring one to <em>past</em> time, and the other to the future. This
                is adopted even by Ewald, but according to the usage of the language
                [rather of modern Hebrew grammar], <em>Waw</em> is conversive of the preterite
                only when preceded by a future, expressed or <em>implied</em>.'
                <small>[By this very extraordinary rule the critic can never have any
                        difficulty, for it is very easy to consider a verbal form implied when
                        it suits his convenience! Yet this egregious absurdity is very commonly
                        adopted in all existing translations, including the Common English
                        Version; e.g., Gen, 9.12-14, where the Hebrew Text has four verbs all in
                        the past tense, yet the first is translated as a present ('I do set'),
                        and the remaining three as futures! The first verb is undoubtedly in the
                        past, 'I have set,' the other three as undoubtedly, seeing the Waw by
                        which they are preceded cannot be conversive, except when preceded by a
                        future or an imperative, neither of which occur in this place. The
                        solution of the supposed difficulty is only to be found in the principle
                        stated above by Prof. A., and which is the basis of the New Translation,
                        and maintained by Gesenius and Lee, that the Hebrews were in the habit
                        of using the past to denote the certainty of an event taking place.]</small>

        </p>
        <p>
                On chap. 9.19, 'Ewald refers the first clause to the past, and
                the second to the present. Umbreit the first to the present, and the
                second to the future. But the very intermingling of the past and the
                future forms shows that the whole was meant to be descriptive.'
                <small>[Would they not be descriptive had they been all past, or all
                        present, or all future?]</small>

        </p>
        <p>
                On chap. 10.14, 'The <em>present</em> form, which Hendewerk adopts
                throughout the verses, is equally grammatical,'--<small>[<em>though the first verb
                                is a</em> perfect, <em>and the second a</em> perfect!]</small>

        </p>
        <p>
                On chap. 14.24, 'Kimchi explains [the verb] to be a preterite
                used for a future, and this construction is adopted in most versions,
                ancient and modern. It is, however, altogether arbitrary, and in
                violation of the only safe rule as to the use of the tenses, viz., that
                they should have their proper and distinctive force, unless forbidden by
                the context or the nature of the subject, which is very far from being
                the case here, as we shall see below. Gesenius and De Wette evade the
                difficulty by rendering both the verbs as presents, a construction which
                is often admissible, and even necessary(!) in a descriptive context, but
                when used indiscriminately or inappropriately, tends both to weaken and
                obscure the sense. Ewald and Umbreit make the first verb present, and
                the second future, which is scarcely, if at all, less objectionable.'

        </p>
        <p>
                The above extracts are surely sufficient to show that Hebrew criticism,
                as hitherto taught, is capable of being used to any purpose, or moulded
                to any form the Critic may wish. Such a state of things surely cannot
                continue any longer, or be adopted by any one who regards simplicity
                more than ingenious guesses, truth more than tradition.

        <p>THE HEBREW has only two tenses, which, for want of better terms, may be
                called <em>Past</em> and <em>Present</em>.</p>

        <p>
                The <em>past</em> is either perfect or imperfect, e.g., 'I <em>lived</em> in
                this house five years,' or 'I <em>have lived</em> in this house five years;'
                this distinction may and can only be known by the context, which must in
                all cases be viewed from the writer's standing-point.

        </p>
        <p>
                In <em>every</em> other instance of its occurrence, it points out
                either--

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <ol>
                <li><em>A gentle imperative</em>, e.g., "Lo, I have sent unto thee Naaman my
                        servant, and thou <em>hast</em> recovered him from his leprosy;" see also Zech.
                        1.3 &amp;c; or

                </li>
                <li><em>A fixed determination</em> that a certain thing shall be done, e.g.,
                        "Nay, my lord, hear me, the field <em>I have given</em> to thee, and the
                        cave that is in it; to thee <em>I have given</em> it; before the eyes of
                        the sons of my people <em>I have given</em> it to thee; bury thy dead;" and
                        in the answer, "Only--if thou wouldst hear me--<em>I have given</em> the
                        money of the field."
                </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
                The <em>present</em> tense--as in the Modern Arabic, Syriac, and
                Amharic, the only living remains of the Semitic languages--besides its
                proper use, is used rhetorically for the future, there being no
                grammatical form to distinguish them; this, however, causes no more
                difficulty than it does in English, Turkish, Greek, Sanscrit, &amp;c., the
                usages of which may be seen in the Extracts from the principal
                grammarians.

        </p>
        <p>
                In <em>every</em> other instance of its occurrence, it points out <em>an
                        imperative</em>, not so gently as when a preterite is used for this purpose,
                nor so stern as when the regular imperative form is employed, but more
                like the infinitive, Thou art <em>to write</em> no more; thou <em>mayest</em> write no
                more.

        </p>
        <p>
                The present participle differs from the present tense just in
                the same manner and to the same extent as "I am writing, or, I am a
                writer," does from, "I write, or, I do write."

        </p>
        <p>
                THE ABOVE VIEW of the Hebrew tenses is equally applicable to all
                the Semitic languages, including the Ancient and Modern Arabic, the
                Ancient and Modern Syriac, the Ancient and Modern Ethiopic, the
                Samaritan, the Chaldee, and the Rabbinical Hebrew--not one of which is
                admitted to have the Waw Conversive.



        </p>
        <p> It may be added, that all the <em>Teutonic</em> languages--fourteen in
                number--agree with the <em>Semitic</em> in rejecting a future tense; the
                futurity of an event being indicated either by auxiliary verbs, adverbs,
                and other particles, or by the context.

                <li><em>Verse 12. And God saith.]</em> The present tense is used, according
                        to the almost universal custom of the Hebrews, &amp;c., to bring up the
                        narrative to the present time. The conjunction <em>and</em> has no special or
                        logical significance, but is used simply to break the abruptness of the
                        opening sentence, as the Hebrews scarcely ever allow a verb in the
                        present or past tense to commence a sentence, especially in prose,
                        without some other word preceding it; the only other way would have been
                        to put the nominative before the verb, but this, though occasionally
                        used, is not agreeable to Hebrew taste.

                        <p>

                        </p>
                </li>
                <li><em>This (is) the token.]</em> The Hebrew substantive verb is, in the
                        present tense, very frequently omitted; in the past tense, it is very
                        rarely, if ever, omitted.

                        <p>

                        </p>
                </li>
                <li><em>That I am making, lit. giving.]</em> The participle is more
                        strikingly expressive of present action than if the present tense had
                        been employed.

                        <p>

                        </p>
                </li>
                <li><em>That (is) with you.]</em> The present tense of the substantive verb
                        is understood as above, according to the <em>unus loquendi</em>.

                        <p>

                        </p>
                </li>
                <li><em> V.13. My bow I have given in the cloud.]</em> The past tense here is
                        used to express a <em>fixed determination</em> that the circumstance mentioned
                        is undoubtedly to take place; most unwarrantably does the Common Version
                        translate as a present, 'I do set;' while the theory of the <em>Waw
                                conversive</em> has no place here, since there is no <em>Waw</em> to work on.

                        <p>

                        </p>
                </li>
                <li><em>And it hath become.]</em> The fixed determination is here continued
                        from the preceding clause; on no grammatical principle can it be
                        rendered present, much less future, as it is in the Common Version; the
                        Waw here can have no converting power, there being no future preceding
                        it to rest on, as the rules of <em>Waw conversive</em> imperatively demand.

                        <p>

                        </p>
                </li>
                <li><em>V.14. It hath come to pass--the bow hath been seen--I have
                                remembered]</em>--though rendered future in the Common Version, are all past,
                        being preceded by pasts, and are to be explained by the same
                        principle--of expressing the certainty of a future action by putting it
                        in the past, owing to the determination of the speaker that it must be.
                </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
                The only remaining verb in the 15th verse is correctly put in
                the present tense; the speaker, going forward in thought to the period
                when the events alluded to take place, declares graphically that 'the
                waters <em>become</em> no more a deluge to destroy all flesh.'

        <p>THE doctrine of "Waw Conversive," according to the common Hebrew
                Grammars, is:--
        </p>
        <ul>

                <li>"The <em>past</em> tense with the prefix <em>waw</em>, expresses future time when
                        preceded by a verb in the <em>future</em> or by an <em>imperative</em>." And again:--
                </li>
                <li>"The <em>future</em> tense, with the prefix <em>waw</em>, and dagesh in the
                        following letter, is used to express the <em>past</em>." <small>[See the Grammars of
                                Hurwitz, Gesenius, &amp;c.]</small>
                </li>
        </ul>
        <em>The objections to this doctrine may be summed up in four particulars</em>:--
        <ol>
                <li start="I"> It is insufficient to explain the many thousands of passages
                        in the Hebrew Bible where a <em>past</em> tense is preceded neither by a
                        <em>future</em> nor by an <em>imperative</em>, yet where it is "converted" in the
                        Common English Bible, and with as much propriety as in any of those
                        instances that are supposed to be indisputable: e.g.

                        <p>
                                Ge. 3.12, "This (is) the token of the covenant that I am making
                                between Me and you ... my bow <em>I have set</em> in the cloud, and it <em>hath
                                        become</em> the token of the covenant ... and it <em>hath come to pass</em> ...
                                and
                                it <em>hath been seen</em> ... and I have remembered ... and the waters do no
                                more," &amp;c.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Ge. 17.4, " Lo, My covenant (is) with thee, and <em>thou hast
                                        become</em> the father of a multitude of nations."

                        <p>
                                The true solution of the principle involved in these passages
                                is: That the Hebrews were in the habit of expressing <em>the certainty of
                                        an action taking place</em> by putting it in the past tense (see
                                particularly Ge. 23.11, "<em>I have given ... I have given ... I have
                                        given</em>;" also in verse 13, "<em>I have given</em>"), taking its fulfilment
                                for
                                granted.

                </li>
                <li>It leads to results rather startling, viz. that most, if not
                        all, of the Hebrew particles are conversive! Grammarians have already
                        been driven to admit, or rather assert, that <em>az</em> then, and <em>terem</em> not
                        yet, are conversive as well as <em>waw</em>.

                        might easily be multiplied), it is evidently an indefinite present,

                        being or continuing in operation at some period afterwards as well as at
                        present.

                                of future action; and there seems no rational way of solving the problem
                                but by regarding the tense as is done above.

                        uninspired literature of the Jews. Attempts have been made to find
                        something like it in the use of the Arabic particle <em>pha</em>, but, as
                        Professor Lee has well remarked (in his Hebrew Grammar and Lexicon), the
                        same thing might be alleged of most other Arabic particles, such as

                                sometimes the word <em>ammal</em> (an agent), which makes it strictly present.

                called Abram, but thy name hath been Abraham, for a father of a
                multitude of nations HAVE I made thee."--Gen. 17.4,5.

        </p>
        <hr width="20%">

        <p>It is the first and the last of the verbs in the above verses to
                which the reader's attention is specially requested, viz, those
                translated in the Common Version, "Thou <em>shalt</em> be," and "I <em>have</em>
                made," and in the New Version, "Thou <em>hast</em> become," and "I <em>have</em>
                made."</p>

        <p>
                Both Versions agree in translating the last verb as a preterite,
                "I <em>have</em> made;" as the form of the verb is admitted on all hands to be
                that of a preterite.

        </p>
        <p>
                The versions differ, however, in the translation of the first
                verb, the one rendering it by the future "shall," the other by the
                preterite "hast."

        </p>
        <p>
                The question at issue is: Which of the two is right? <em>both</em>
                cannot be right--one <em>must</em> be wrong.



        </p>
        <p> It is undoubtedly in the preterite form, precisely like the last
                verb in the sentence, admitted on all hands to be a preterite. Why then
                should this not be translated as a preterite likewise ?

        </p>
        <p>
                If it be said, that the <em>sense</em> requires it to be translated as
                a future, seeing it is not literally true that Abraham <em>was</em> a father of
                many nations at the moment that God addressed these words to him, then,
                <em>on precisely the same principle</em>, the last verb ought to be translated
                as a future, "I <em>will</em> make thee,"--not "I <em>have</em> made thee," as both
                versions agree in doing--as it is not literally true, that, at the
                moment when God thus addressed him, He <em>had</em> made him a father of many
                nations.

        </p>
        <p>
                If no one will venture to translate the last verb as a future,
                why should the first be so rendered?

        </p>
        <p>
                If it be said that the first verb has a conjunction before it,
                called <em>Waw</em>, signifying "and," and that the Hebrew Grammarians have
                laid it down as an idiom of the language, that, in certain
                circumstances, <em>Waw</em> before a preterite indicates that the preterite is
                to be reckoned as a future, the answer is: These circumstances do not
                exist in the present case.

        </p>
        <p>
                The fundamental Rule laid down by all Hebrew Grammarians to
                regulate <em>Waw Conversive</em> is: that the first verb to be converted must
                be preceded by one of a different tense, e.g., a preterite must be
                preceded by a future, and a future by a preterite.

        </p>
        <p>
                But, in the passage before us, there is, in the Hebrew, no verb
                at all preceding the one supposed to be converted, and consequently the
                Rule cannot operate.

        </p>

                <em>On no principle of Hebrew Grammar, as commonly taught</em>, can the
                Conversive Principle come into operation in this passage, and it is only
                one out of <em>hundreds of similar instances</em>.

        </p>
        <p>
                The solution of the matter is found in the principle: That the
                Hebrews were in the habit of using the preterite form of the verb to
                denote a fixed determination that the things mentioned <em>shall</em> and
                <em>must</em> take place; this principle is common to all the Semitic
                languages; it is distinctly admitted by the best Hebrew Grammarians; it
                is common to the New Testament Writers, and to the whole series of Greek
                and Latin Classics, (see Winer, Stuart, Kuhner, &amp;c.) and it is the only
                one that meets all cases.

        </p>
        <p>
                The <em>Waw Conversive</em>, on the contrary, is unknown in <em>every</em>
                other Hebrew composition--in <em>every</em> other Semitic dialect--in <em>every</em>
                other language on earth.

        <p> THE oldest writings in the Hebrew language, after the Old Testament, are
                the <em>Talmuds</em>, large portions of which we have examined to find some
                examples of Waw Conversive, but in vain; we have not found a single
                instance of a preterite converted into a future, or any thing that bears
                the slightest resemblance to it.</p>

        <p>
                With the same view we have read large portions of the best
                Rabbinical Commentators, Kimchi, Jarchi, Aben-Ezra; the Jewish
                Prayer-Books, the Hebrew translations of the New Testament, of the
                Pilgrim's Progress, of Dr M'Caul's Old Paths, and have looked over other
                Hebrew works too numerous to mention, and all with the same negative
                result. How is it at all possible that the Hebrew language, as found in
                the Old Testament, can have a Waw Conversive, if it be wanting in all
                the oldest and most valued later Hebrew writings? Can credulity go
                farther?

        </p>
        <p>
                The <em>astounding fact</em> is: that, out of the hundreds of languages
                which are, and have been, spoken on the earth, not one, except the
                Hebrew, is supposed to have the Waw Conversive; while, out of the
                hundreds of volumes which have been published in the Hebrew language,
                not one, except the Old Testament, has the Waw Conversive!

                actually taken place, the design of the writers in this case was to mark
                the future occurrence as something already evidently decreed and decided
                on, and therefore as it were accomplished: thus Ge. 15.18, 'To thy sons

                languages, as well as the <em>Romaic</em>, at one period of their history, all
                rejected the ancient inflected futures, and formed new compound or
                auxiliary ones, employing for that purpose the verbs <em>will</em> and <em>shall</em>,
                or <em>have</em> in the sense of duty or necessity, though French, Italian,
                Spanish and Portuguese, have now agglutinated the infinite and auxiliary
                into a simple future.

                "Why is it that the Gothic languages have always possessed a
                <em>past</em> tense, never a <em>future</em>? Why did the Romance dialects retain the
                Latin <em>past</em> forms, and reject the Latin <em>future</em>?"

        </p>
        <p>
                "If the expression of time is an inherent necessity of the verb,
                special forms for the future as well as the present and the past ought
                to be universal, but in most modern European languages, the future is a
                compound, the elements of which are a <em>present</em> auxiliary and an
                <em>aorist</em> infinitive, for in the phrases I <em>shall</em> go, he <em>will</em> go,
                <em>shall</em> and <em>will</em> are in the present tense, and <em>go</em> is aoristic.

        <p>
                "The Anglo-Saxon, with a single exception in the case of a
                substantive verb, had absolutely no mode of expressing the future by any
                verbal form, simple or compound. The context alone determined the time,
                and in German, in the Scandinavian dialects, and in English, we still
                very commonly, as the Anglo-Saxons did, express the future by a present.

                                <li>Because it is admitted by Ewald, Gesenius, Lee, Rodiger, and every
                                        other Hebrew Grammarian of name, that it is so in numberless places,
                                        and because there are thousands of instances where the Common English
                                        Version, and all other versions, ancient and modern, do rightly
                                        translate it as a <em>present</em>.


                                </li>
                                <li>Because there are numerous passages where it cannot possibly be a
                                        <em>future</em>; and as it is impossible, in the very nature of things, for a

                                        in almost all languages, rhetorically to express futurity by a
                                        present--it must be a present, and not a future.


                                </li>
                                <li>Because in all the Cognate Semitic Dialects it is regarded as a

                                <li>To express a gentle <em>imperative</em>; this is universally agreed by all

                                        imperative, e.g., "Speak and say," lit., Speak, and thou hast said;
                                        but this limitation of theirs arises from imperfect acquaintance with
                                        the facts of the case, as there are many passages where there is no
                                        imperative preceding, yet where the past tense is used to express a
                                        command, e.g., Zech. 1.3, "And thou hast said," i.e, "Say thou." This
                                        idiom is also admitted to be common in all the Cognate Semitic

                        <ol>

                                <li>It supposes <em>yiqtol</em> to be an <em>exclusively future</em> form, which is

                                </li>
                                <li>It casts the utmost uncertainty over the language, as, on the very

                                <li>It does not explain all the phenomena of the case, for there are
                                        numberless passages "where a past tense is preceded neither by a

                in the Hebrew Bible, and is Unnecessary, Imperfect, and Unexampled in
                any language.

                It has only a <em>traditional</em> existence, being the too hasty
                <em>generalization</em> of some ancient grammarians, who observed that the
                Septuagint Translators had--with the freedom which characterizes their
                whole work both in style and sentiments--deemed the Hebrew idioms too
                <em>colloquial</em> for the fastidious Greeks, and too <em>simple</em> for the dignity
                of literary composition; and as all succeeding translators, without an
                exception, were under the spell of the sacred character of that Version,
                it is no wonder, though much to be regretted, that their example was
                followed. Of late years there has been a very strong tendency in
                translators and expositors to adhere more than ever to the exact form of
                the Hebrew and Greek Tenses, but the present Translation is the first
                and only one in which it is carried out systematically.

        <p>The English verb 'destroy' is, in the Common Version, the
                representative of not less than forty-nine different Hebrew words (as
                may be seen in the 'Englishman's Hebrew Concordance,' p. 1510 of second
                edition);-- the verb 'to set,' of forty, and 'to bring,' of thirty-nine,
                &amp;c. It ia evident, therefore, that the use of 'Cruden's Concordance,'
                and all others based on the Common Version, can only mislead the mere
                English reader.</p>

                representatives (according to the Common Version) expressed in numerals,
                will surprise all who have not hitherto attended to this subject; viz:--

        <p>There cannot be the slightest doubt in the mind of any reflecting person but
                that a much greater amount of error in reference to the truths of the Word of
                God arises from simple ignorance or inattention than from any other worse
                cause whatever. Words, in the course of time, lose their original meaning, and
                acquire a conventional one very often considerably different, and which, from
                constant use, becomes little more than the shibboleth of a party. Very many are
                accustomed to use Scripture language without at all being able to understand
                its real meaning, and thus they are rather injured than benefited by their
                familiarity with Scripture phraseology. The following are only a selection and
                specimen of what a variety of words may be illustrated from presenting their

<h4 id="2edition">Preface to the Revised Edition.</h4>

<p>THE following Translation of the New Testament is based upon the belief
        that every word of the original is "God-breathed," as the Apostle Paul
        says in his Second Epistle to Timothy, chap. 3.16. That language is,
        indeed, applicable, in the first place, only to the Writings of the "Old
        Testament," in which Timothy had been instructed, but as the Apostle
        Peter, in his Second Epistle, chap. 3.15,16, expressly ranks the
        "Epistles" of his beloved brother Paul along with "the other
        Scriptures," as the "Gospels" and the "Acts" of the Apostles were
        undoubtedly written before the date of Peter's writing, by men to whom
        the Saviour promised and gave the Holy Spirit, to <em>guide</em> them to all
        truth, to teach them all things, and to <em>remind</em> them of all things that
        Jesus said and did, there can be no reasonable ground for denying the
        inspiration of the New Testament by any one who holds that of the Old,
        or who is willing to take the plain unsophisticated meaning of God's
        Word regarding either.</p>
<p>
        This inspiration extends only to the original text, <em>as it came
                from the pens of the writers</em>, not to any translations ever made by man,
        however aged, venerable, or good; and only in so far as any of these
        adhere to the original--neither adding to nor omitting from it one
        particle--are they of any <em>real value</em>, for, to the extent that they
        vary from the original, the doctrine of verbal inspiration is lost, so
        far as that version is concerned.
</p>
<p>
        If a translation gives a <em>present tense</em> when the original gives
        a <em>past</em>, or a <em>past</em> when it has a <em>present</em>; a <em>perfect</em> for a
        <em>future</em>, or a <em>future</em> for a <em>perfect</em>; an <em>a</em> for a <em>the</em>, or a
        <em>the</em>
        for an <em>a</em>; an <em>imperative</em> for a <em>subjunctive</em>, or a <em>subjunctive</em> for
        an <em>imperative</em>; a <em>verb</em> for a <em>noun</em>, or a <em>noun</em> for a <em>verb</em>, it
        is
        clear that verbal inspiration is as much overlooked as if it had no
        existence. THE WORD OF GOD IS MADE VOID BY THE TRADITIONS OF MEN.
</p>
<p>
        A <em>strictly literal</em> rendering may not be so pleasant to the ear
        as one where the <em>apparent sense</em> is chiefly aimed at, yet it is not
        <em>euphony</em> but <em>truth</em> that ought to be sought, and where in such a
        version as the one commonly in use in this country, there are scarcely
        <em>two consecutive verses</em> where there is not some departure from the
        original such as those indicated, and where these variations may be
        counted by <em>tens of thousands</em>, as admitted on all hands, it is
        difficult to see how verbal inspiration can be of the least practical
        use to those who depend upon that version alone.

</p>
<p>
        Modern scholarship is beginning to be alive to the inconsistency
        of thus gratuitously obscuring, and really changing, the meaning, of the
        sacred writers by subjective notions of what they <em>ought</em> to have
        written, rather than what they <em>did</em> write, for if we admit that in a
        single case it can be lawful to render a <em>past</em> tense by a <em>present</em>,
        where shall we end? who is to be judge? if we do so in one passage, to
        bring out what may appear to us might, could, would, or should, be the
        Scriptural meaning, we cannot deny the same privilege to others who may
        twist other passages in like manner. The alteration of an <em>a</em> for a
        <em>the</em> may appear a small matter not worth speaking of, but an attentive
        comparison of the following Translation with the common one will
        discover numerous passages where the <em>entire force</em> of the verse depends
        upon the insertion or non-insertion of the article.

</p>
<p>
        For example, in Mat. 2.4, Herod is represented as enquiring
        "where Christ ' should be born. But "Christ" is the surname of the man
        Jesus, who was quite unknown to Herod, who could not consequently ask
        for a person of whose existence he was ignorant. The true explanation
        is, that King James' Translators omitted the definite article which
        occurs in the original. The correct translation is, where "the Christ"
        should be born. Herod knew of "<em>the</em> Christ," <em>the</em> Messiah, <em>the</em> long
        promised Saviour and King of the Jews, and his enquiry was, where He was
        to be born, whose kingdom was to be over all. The simple article clears
        up the whole. There are about <em>two thousand</em> instances in the New
        Testament where these translators have thus omitted all notice of the
        definite article, not to say any thing of the great number of passages
        where they have <em>inserted</em> it, though not in the original.

</p>
<p>
        The following translation need not, and ought not, to be
        considered, in any sense, as coming into competition with the Common
        Version, but as one to be used in connection with it, and as auxiliary
        to it; and not a few assurances have been received from clergymen and
        others that they thus use it, and find it at once interesting and
        profitable. The change of a single word, or collocation of words, is
        often found to throw an entirely new shade of meaning over the
        Scripture. This advantage is well known to all who have compared the
        various ancient versions, or even the English versions that successively
        formed what was popularly called "the authorized version," i.e.,
        Tyndale, Coverdale, Geneva, Bishops, &amp;c.

</p>
<p>
        The Greek Text followed is that generally recognized as the
        "Received Text," not because it is thought perfect, but because the
        department of Translation is quite distinct from that of Textual
        Criticism, and few are qualified for both. If the original text be
        altered by a translator, (except he give his reasons for and against
        each emendation,) the reader is left in uncertainty whether the
        translation given is to be considered as that of the old or of the new
        reading. And, after all, the differences in sense to be found in the
        100,000 various Greek readings are so trifling compared with those to be
        derived from an <em>exact</em> translation of the Received Text, that the
        writer willingly leaves them to other hands; at the same time, it is
        contemplated, in a future edition, to give, in an Appendix, all the
        various readings of the Greek MSS. that are capable of being expressed
        in English.

</p>
<p>
        With grateful thanks to the Father of Lights, this revised
        edition is presented to the friends of Divine Truth, with the hope that
        it may be a means, in the hands of the Divine Spirit, of quickening
        their faith, and encouraging their hearts, in the work of the Lord.

<h4 id="3edition">Publishers' Note to the Third Edition</h4>

<p>NOTWITHSTANDING the fact that the Revised Version of the Old and the New
        Testament has come into the field since the learned and lamented author
        first issued his <em>Literal Translation of the Bible</em>, the demand for it
        from year to year has continued remarkably steady. This indicates that
        it still fills a place of its own among helps to the earnest student of
        Holy Scripture. In 1887 Dr Young issued a Revised Edition, of which two
        impressions are exhausted. The work has been subjected to a fresh
        revision, making no alteration on the principles on which the
        Translation proceeds, but endeavouring to make it as nearly perfect in
        point of accuracy on its present lines as possible. The Publishers
        accordingly issue this new Revised Edition in the hope that earnest
        students of the Bible, by attaining to a clearer apprehension of the
        meaning of the inspired writer, may more clearly and fully apprehend the
        mind of the Spirit by whom all Holy Scripture has been given to us.</p>
